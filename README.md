# Steven Abdelshahid's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a **computer engineering student** with experience in C, Verilog, microcontroller programming, and circuit design. Below are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on and my skills.

## Projects

### 1. Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A web-based tool for visualizing different sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and bubble sort. It includes features like reshuffling, a pause/play button, and algorithm switching during visualization.  
**Tech Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
